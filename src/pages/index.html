  <p>I’m a JavaScript/CSS nerd who believes diverse teams can build the most impactful outcomes. I thrive in creating scalable and understandable design systems.</p>
  <p>Currently, I’m working at <a href="https://www.scribd.com">Scribd</a> as a front-end software engineer, having transitioned within the company from being a product designer. I’ve also been working on my new CSS framework called <a href="http://www.getmonolith.io">Monolith</a>.</p>
  <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.adorable.io">Adorable</a> as a UX engineer, helped build the early versions of <a href="https://www.codecov.io">Codecov’s</a> website (including designing the logo), and even further back, as a UX designer at <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com">Musicnotes</a>.</p>
